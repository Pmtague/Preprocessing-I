      <h2>More Awesomeness...</h2>

      <p>I was born a tech prodigy. My first words were not spoken, but were written in code. 
         Need a commerce website that can literally read customer's minds? I can build it. 
         Want a robot vaccuum that can also tackle household tasks such as laundry and dishes? 
         I made one yesterday on my lunch break. Take a look at my skills and work history, then show me the money!</p>
